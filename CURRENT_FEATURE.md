# Current Feature: Catalog
## Feature branch name: Feature/Catalog

## Steps
### 1. Define Catalog Data Model [COMPLETE]
- Create classes that represent the entities in your database (e.g., Book, Author, Category).
- Include properties in these classes that correspond to the columns in your database tables.
- Use data annotations for validations and entity framework mappings if you are using Entity Framework.
### 2. Set Up Data Access Layer [COMPLETE]
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-data-access
- Create a repository layer for data access logic.
- Implement methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity.
- If using Entity Framework, this would involve creating DbContext and DbSet for your entities.
### 3. Business Logic Layer
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-business-logic
- Create services or business logic classes that will use the repository layer to perform operations.
- Implement the logic for catalog management, like adding new books, searching the catalog, updating book details, etc.
### 4. Create API or User Interface
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-user-interface
- If you are making a web-based system, create API controllers for handling HTTP requests.
- If it's a desktop application, design the user interface forms.
- Bind your UI components or API endpoints to the business logic layer methods.
### 5. Implement Catalog Features
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-features
- Implement features like adding new books, listing all books, searching for books, editing book information, etc.
- Ensure to handle validations and display appropriate messages for success or errors.
### 6. Testing
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-testing
- Write unit tests for your business logic to ensure your code works as expected.
- Test the user interface or API endpoints to make sure they are correctly interacting with the business logic and data access layers.
### 7. Error Handling and Logging
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-error-handling
- Implement error handling to catch and log any unexpected exceptions.
- Ensure user-friendly error messages are displayed or returned.
### 8. Security Considerations
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-security
- If your application is web-based, implement security measures like authentication and authorization.
- Ensure that sensitive data is protected and user actions are authorized.
### 9. Documentation
#### Branch name: Task/catalog-documentation
- Document your API endpoints if it's a web application.
- Create user manuals or help documents for end-users if it's a desktop application.
